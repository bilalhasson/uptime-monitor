# Deploying to Railway

This project deploys as **5 components** from this single GitHub repo:

| Component | Type | Start command |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **web** | service (gunicorn) | Procfile default: `migrate && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT` |
| **worker** | service (Celery) | `celery -A uptime_monitor worker --loglevel=info` |
| **beat** | service (Celery) | `celery -A uptime_monitor beat --loglevel=info` |
| **PostgreSQL** | Railway database | provides `DATABASE_URL` |
| **Redis** | Railway database | provides `REDIS_URL` |

## Setup checklist

1. **Add databases** — in the project canvas: **+ New → Database → PostgreSQL**, then **→ Redis**.
2. **web service variables** (Variables tab):
   ```
   SECRET_KEY   = <unique per project — see Credentials>
   DEBUG        = False
   DATABASE_URL = ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
   REDIS_URL    = ${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
   ```
   `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is injected automatically — `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and
   `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` pick it up in `settings.py`.
3. **worker service** — **+ New → GitHub Repo** (same repo), then:
   - Settings → Deploy → Custom Start Command: `celery -A uptime_monitor worker --loglevel=info`
   - Variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` (same references as web), and `C_FORCE_ROOT = true`
4. **beat service** — same again:
   - Custom Start Command: `celery -A uptime_monitor beat --loglevel=info`
   - Variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `C_FORCE_ROOT = true`
5. **Create a superuser** (one-time) — from the web service shell:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

Tip: use Railway **project-level shared variables** for values common to all
three services so you set them once instead of per service.

## `C_FORCE_ROOT`

Celery logs a `SecurityWarning` when it runs as root, which it does inside
Railway's containers. The container is isolated, so this is safe here. Setting
`C_FORCE_ROOT = true` on the **worker** and **beat** services silences the
warning. (A non-root `--uid` would be the textbook fix but isn't practical
under Nixpacks.)

## Credentials

Production secrets are stored in **Bitwarden** under a `deploy/<project>` item
— that vault is the source of truth for recovery and rotation. Conventions:

- **Unique `SECRET_KEY` per project** — never reuse across apps. Generate with:
  ```
  python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
  ```
- Real values live only as Railway env vars — never commit them.
- `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` are managed by Railway's plugins via `${{...}}`
  references; don't copy them into the vault (they rotate on Railway's side).
- Local dev uses a gitignored `.env` with throwaway values.
